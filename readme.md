# What's a NeRF?

Ne(ural) R(adiance) F(ield)s represent a surface by approximating how much light is blocked at
each point in space, and the color of the surface that is blocking it. This approximation can be
used with volumetric rendering to view a surface from new angles.

The original paper implements this idea, and demonstrates its capacity for reconstructing a
surface or scene from a set of views. It has insanely high quality of reconstruction, but takes
forever to train, isn't modifiable at all, and takes a stupid amount of memory. In order to
fix those issues, there are a bunch of different repos which implement single changes to the
original that give it new capabilities, make it train faster, or give it wings, but
no projects mix multiple different modifications. This repo is supposed to be a single
unified interface to many different extensions.  I've implemented a number of other projects,
but there are more. Please feel free to contribute any you would like!

NeRF is similar to projects like [COLMAP](https://demuc.de/colmap/) in that it can perform
surface reconstruction from a series of images, but has not yet been shown to be able to scale
to incredibly large scales while jointly working without prior known camera angles.

The original project is [here](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf),
but math to understand why it works is [here](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Volume_Scattering).

## Usage

```sh
python3 runner.py -h
<All the flags>
```

See makefile for example usages. i.e.
```sh
make dnerf
make dnerfae
make original
```

One note for usage:
- I've found that using large crop-size with small number of batches may lead to better
  training.
- DNeRF is great at reproducing images at training time, but I had trouble getting good test
  results. I noticed that they have an [additional loss](https://github.com/albertpumarola/D-NeRF/issues/1) in their code,
  which isn't mentioned in their paper, but it's not clear to me whether it was used.

## Dependencies

PyTorch, NumPy, tqdm, matplotlib, imageio.

Install them how you want.

Notes on dependency versions:

This library makes use of `tensordot(..., dims=0)`, which is [broken in PyTorch
1.9](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/61096). If you find this while using the library,
please downgrade to 1.8

## Extensions:

Currently, this repository contains a few extensions on "Plain" NeRF.

Model Level:

- TinyNeRF: One MLP for both density and output spectrum.
- PlainNeRF: Same architecture as original, probably different parameters.
- NeRFAE (NeRF Auto Encoder): Our extension, which encodes every point in space as a vector in a
  latent material space, and derives density and RGB from this latent space. In theory this
  should allow for similar points to be learned more effectively.
- [VolSDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12052.pdf) Extends NeRF by volume rendering an SDF.
  This is probably one of the most practical ways to do volume rendering, i.e. seems like the
  most promising method because it merges both volumetric and surface rendering.
- [D-NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13961) for dynamic scenes, using an MLP to encode a
  positional change.
  - Convolutional Update Operator based off of [RAFT's](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12039.pdf).
    Interpolation is definitely not what it's design was intended for, but is more memory
    efficient.
- \[WIP\][Pixel NeRF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02190.pdf) for single image NeRF
  reconstruction.

Encoding:

- Positional Encoding, as in the original paper.
- [Fourier Features](https://github.com/tancik/fourier-feature-networks).
- Learned Features based on [Siren](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661): Pass low dimensional
  features through an MLP and then use `sin` activations. Not sure if it works.
- [MipNeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13415) can be turned on with cylinder or conic volumes.

Training/Efficiency:

- DataParallel can be turned on and off.
- Train on cropped regions of the image for smaller GPUs.
- Neural Upsampling with latent spaces inspired by
  [GIRAFFE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12100.pdf). The results don't look great, but to be fair
  the paper also has some artifacts.

Note: NeRF is stupid slow. Writing out one of these extensions takes about half an hour,
training it takes about a day, and my GPU is much smaller than any used in the papers.

**Datasets Supported**:

- NeRF Synthetic (`--data-kind original`)
- Dynamic NeRF (`--data-kind dnerf`)
- NeRV (`--data-kind nerv_point`)
- DTU Scans (`--data-kind dtu`)
- NeRFActor (same as NeRF synthetic)

### Example outputs

![Example Output Gif](examples/example.gif)

- Collecting datasets for this is difficult. If you have a dataset that you'd like contributed,
  add _a script to download it_ to the `data/` directory!

The outputs I've done are low-res because I'm working off a 3GB gpu and NeRF is memory intensive
during training. That's why I've explored a few different encodings and other tricks to speed it
up.

##### Dynamic NeRF Auto-Encoded

![dnerfae jumpingjacks](examples/dnerfae.gif)

A new change to NeRF using NeRF with an auto-encoder at every point in space. Since we're
mapping to a latent space at every point, it's possible to learn a transformation on that latent
space, for modifying density and visual appearance over time. One downside is that it is much
slower to train because of the higher number of dimensions, and may overfit due to the higher
number of dimensions.

The visualization is on the training set. On the test set it does not perform as well. I suspect
it lacks some regularization for temporal consistency, but I'll continue to look for ways to
make testing better.

##### Smoothly Interpolated Movement

![DNeRF Hook 1](outputs/hook1.gif)
![DNeRF Hook 2](outputs/hook2.gif)
![DNeRF Squat](outputs/squat.gif)

Developed a model which allows for guaranteed smooth interpolation at infinite resolution as
compared to prior work, with no need for additional regularization.

##### DTU

![DTU shiny cans](examples/dtu.gif)

##### VolSDF

![VolSDF Lego](examples/volsdf.gif)

Implementation of [VolSDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12052), which produces better quality
output on the low sample counts necessary to run on my machine. It also noticeably has much less
flickering than standard NeRF, because within a region near the surface it is less likely
(guaranteed?) to not have holes unlike standard NeRF.
