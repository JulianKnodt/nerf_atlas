# NeRF Atlas

A repository which contains NeRF and a bunch of extensions to NeRF.

Important Note:
WORK IN PROGRESS, things may be subtly _borken_ ðŸ¦®.

---

## Usage

```sh
python3 runner.py -h
<All the flags>
```

One note for usage:
- I've found that using large crop-size with small number of batches may lead to better
  training.

## Dependencies

PyTorch, NumPy, tqdm, matplotlib.
Install them how you want.

## Extensions:

Currently, this repository contains a few extensions on "Plain" NeRF.

Model Level:

- TinyNeRF: One MLP for both density and output spectrum.
- NeRFAE (NeRF Auto Encoder): Our extension, which encodes every point in space as a vector in a
  latent material space, and derives density and RGB from this latent space. In theory this
  should allow for similar points to be learned more effectively.
- [D-NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13961) for dynamic scenes, using an MLP to encode a
  positional change.
- \[WIP\][Pixel NeRF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02190.pdf) for single image NeRF
  reconstruction.

Encoding:

- [Fourier Features](https://github.com/tancik/fourier-feature-networks) are applied to all
  low-dimensional inputs. This is always on.
- [MipNeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13415) can be turned on with cylinder or conic volumes.

Training/Efficiency:

- DataParallel can be turned on and off.
- Train on cropped regions of the image for smaller GPUs.
- Neural Upsampling with latent spaces inspired by
  [GIRAFFE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12100.pdf). The results don't look great, but to be fair
  the paper also has some artifacts.

### Example outputs

![Example Output Gif](examples/example.gif)

- Collecting datasets for this is difficult. If you have a dataset that you'd like contributed,
  add _a script to download it_ to the `data/` directory!

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, feel free to submit a PR, but I may be somewhat strict,
apologies in advance.

Please maintain the same style:
- 2 spaces, no tabs
- Concise but expressive names
- Default arguments and type annotations when possible.
- Single line comments for functions, intended for developers.
