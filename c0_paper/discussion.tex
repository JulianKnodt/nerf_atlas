\section{Discussion}

Our method produces coherent movement in objects without explicit regularization, and is able to
converge much faster as compared to prior work. It also does not suffer extremely significant
around time extremities as compared to D-NeRF, since we are analytically able to ensure that at
time 0 there is no motion.

In addition, our method demonstrates extremely smooth interpolation, as enforced by the network.
We are thus able to exaggerate movements significantly. Also because of the analytic nature
of splines, we are likely able to perform interesting motion deformations, such as diverging
motion paths in order to construct novel motion.

One issue with our approach is that because it is forced to learn continuous representations, it
has some difficulty when surfaces collide and bounce apart, as it must separate each surface but
the boundary between them may be very small and thus hard to distinguish.
