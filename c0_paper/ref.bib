abstract = {The quality of computer generated images of three-dimensional scenes depends on the shading technique used to paint the objects on the cathode-ray tube screen. The shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object, which also determines the hidden surface algorithm. The various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden surface removal are thus strongly interconnected. Several shading techniques corresponding to different methods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here. Human visual perception and the fundamental laws of optics are considered in the development of a shading rule that provides better quality and increased realism in generated images.},

	abstract = {Abstract A neural network method for reducing data dimensionality based on the concept of input training, in which each input pattern is not fixed but adjusted along with internal network parameters to reproduce its corresponding output pattern, is presented. With input adjustment, a property configured network can be trained to reproduce a given data set with minimum distortion; the trained network inputs provide reduced data. A three-layer network with input training can perform all functions of a flue-layer autoassociative network, essentially capturing nonlinear correlations among data. In addition, simultaneous training of a network and its inputs is shown to be significantly more efficient in reducing data dimensionality than training an autoassociative network The concept of input training is closely related to principal component analysis (PCA) and the principal curve method, which is a nonlinear extension of PCA.},

	abstract = {From the Publisher:A basic problem in computer vision is to understand the structure of a real world scene given several images of it. Recent major developments in the theory and practice of scene reconstruction are described in detail in a unified framework. The book covers the geometric principles and how to represent objects algebraically so they can be computed and applied. The authors provide comprehensive background material and explain how to apply the methods and implement the algorithms directly.}

Our system is built on a set of new, distributed computer vision algorithms for image matching and 3D reconstruction, designed to maximize parallelism at each stage of the pipeline and to scale gracefully with both the size of the problem and the amount of available computation. Our experimental results demonstrate that it is now possible to reconstruct city-scale image collections with more than a hundred thousand images in less than a day.},
