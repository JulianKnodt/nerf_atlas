\subsection{Bezier Curves}

Bezier curves refer to a class of functions defined as a polynomial parametrized by a set of
control points. They are most commonly used as cubic polynomials: $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$,
where x is the variable we are interested in interpolating over. The general formulation for
the Bezier basis functions is defined as $B^n(t) = \Sigma^n_{i=0} {n}\choose{i} (1-t)^{n-i} t^i$ where n
is the degree of the Bezier polynomial. In order to give control of the Bezier curve, we
introduce "control points", which weighs different points along the curve differently:
$B^n(t) = \Sigma^n_{i=0} P_i {n}\choose{i} (1-t)^{n-i} t^i$, where $P_i\in\mathbb{R}^3$ for 3D
movement. For a more complete reference on Bezier splines, we refer the reader to a more
