\begin{abstract}
Methodology for predicting smooth functions over time using neural nets has previously relied on
some form of consistency loss to ensure smoothness over time, which has showed good results on
short sequences, where it is able to effectively apply the loss function over the whole duration.
This approach is difficult to scale to larger sequences, as it requires more pairwise
constraints as the sequence length grows.

We propose an alternate formulation, which ensures $C^0$ continuity of sequences using a
Bezier-spline formulation. We examine the problem of smooth function reconstruction for dynamic
scenes using NeRF, but note that our approach is much more general and can be applied to a large
variety of problems. For dynamic NeRF, we are interested in reconstructing a ray-warping
function $f(x\in\mathbb{R}^3,t\in[0,1])\to\delta(x)$. We decompose this into two functions,
$f(x\in\mathbb{R}^3)\to\beta, B_\beta(t)\to\delta(x)$, where $B_\beta$ is a Bezier spline
parametrized by the control points $\beta$. This allows for $C^0$, and in this case $C^1$ continuity,
allowing for perfect interpolation in time. We model $f(x\in\mathbb{R}^3)\to\beta$ as an MLP,
blending machine learning with classical animation techniques. All code is available at \url{https://github.com/JulianKnodt/nerf_atlas}.

    \caption{The proposed model is able to recover dynamic movements in synthetic data, with plausible flow maps. With a classical formulation of movement using Bezier splines, we impose a stronger prior on the kind of movement that can be reproduced, while enforcing that it is smooth. We compare our model to an implementation of D-NeRF~\cite{pumarola2020dnerf}, and find our model is able to slightly outperform it. This can be seen qualitatively in video, as the movement characterized by ours is much smoother.}
