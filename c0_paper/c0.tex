\begin{abstract}
The problem of reconstructing continuous functions over time is important for problems such as reconstructing moving scenes, music generation, and plausible interpolation.
Previous approaches that use deep-learning rely on regularization to ensure that reconstructions are approximately continuous, which works well on short sequences. As sequence length grows, though, it becomes more difficult to regularize, and it becomes less feasible to learn only through regularization.

We propose a new architecture for function reconstruction based on classical Bezier splines, which ensures $C^0, C^1$-continuity, where $C^0$ continuity is that $\forall c:\lim\limits_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c)$, or more intuitively, there are no breaks at any point in the function. In order to demonstrate our architecture, we reconstruct dynamic scenes using Neural Radiance Fields, but hope it is clear that our approach is general and can be applied to a variety of problems. We recover a function $B_(\beta, t\in[0,1])$, where $B$ is a Bezier spline
parametrized by the control points $\beta$. Using Bezier splines, reconstructions ensures $C^0$ and $C^1$ continuity, allowing for guaranteed interpolation over time. We reconstruct $\beta$ with an MLP, blending machine learning with classical animation techniques. All code is available at

    A Bezier spline model is able to recover dynamic movements in synthetic data, with realistic flow maps. Using a classical formulation of movement using Bezier splines, we impose a strong prior on the kind of movement that can be reproduced, while enforcing that it is smooth. We compare our model to an implementation of D-NeRF~\cite{pumarola2020dnerf}, and find our model is able to slightly outperform it. This can be seen qualitatively in video, as the movement characterized by ours appears smoother.
